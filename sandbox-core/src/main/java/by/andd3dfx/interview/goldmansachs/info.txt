
First of all, it is highly recommended to start reading the following book (engineering sections): http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/contents.html

What to revise:
•	complexity of sorting algorithms
•	after solving every issue algorithm’s time complexity is usually discussed
•	DFS/BFS are frequently asked during coding interviews
•	solving some Dynamic programming problems would be useful because they are less intuitive than for example Greedy
•	Questions similar to climbing stairs: https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/description/
